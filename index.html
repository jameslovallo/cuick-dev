				<h1>Cuick</h1>
				<p>
					Create fast, self-documenting components that work
					<i>anywhere</i>, without <i>any</i> tooling.
				</p>
				<h2>Features</h2>
				<p>
					Cuick is lightning fast, works anywhere, and has a beginner-friendly
					API, documented in the interactive playgrounds below. Fun fact: those
					playgrounds are powered by Cuick's
					<code>&lt;c-story&gt;</code> component, which automatically creates
					interactive documentation for a nested Cuick component.
				</p>
				<c-code src="/docs/components/counter.js"></c-code>
				<h3>Props</h3>
				<p>
					Properties allow you to configure your component. To create a prop,
					simply add a key in the component's options object. Props whose
					default values are defined as booleans or numbers will be converted
					back to that type when the component's corresponding attribute is
					updated.

				<h3>Signals</h3>
				<p>
					Reactive properties (signals) store stateful data and efficiently
					update the component's markup when the data is changed. To create a
					signal, add a key to the component's options object begging with a
					"$".
				</p>

				</c-story>
				<h3>Slots</h3>
				<p>
					Slots allow you to inject child elements anywhere inside your
					component's Shadow DOM. You can use a default slot or multiple named
					slots. To assign a child element to a named slot, add the "slot"
					attribute to the element and set the value to the name of the slot.
				</p>
				<c-story>
					<c-toolbar style="background: indigo">
						<a slot="left">Left</a>
						<span slot="center">Center</span>
						<a slot="right">Right</a>
					</c-toolbar>
				</c-story>
				<h3
					style="
						display: flex;
						align-items: baseline;
						justify-content: space-between;
					"

					Watched Elements
					<demo-i18n></demo-i18n>
				</h3>
				<p>
					Watched elements allow your component to synchronize with another
					component's properties. This is very useful for groups of components
					that need to be able to react to each other, for example an i18n
					system or a carousel with external control elements. To watch an
					element, add a key to the component's options object that begins with
					a "_" and set the value to the selector for the element the component
					should watch for updates.
				</p>
				<p>
					In the example below, the language switcher on the right side of the
					site nav updates the "lang" attribute on the
					<code>&lt;demo-i18n&gt;</code> element (shown as a flag above), which
					triggers the nav to update it's translation to match the "lang"
					attribute's updated value. Any other components listening to the same
					element's "lang" attribute will also update, regardless of how the
					elements are arranged in the DOM.
